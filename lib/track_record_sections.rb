# File::    track_record_sections.rb
# (C)::     Hipposoft 2008
#
# Purpose:: Mixin providing abstract section handling for various bits
#           of TrackRecord code. Sections are defined in terms of an
#           array of tasks in some pre-sorted order. Going from one task
#           to the next, in order, may cause a new project and / or
#           customer to be encountered related to that task; in such a
#           case, the task is deemed to mark the start of a new section.
#
#           A similar concept is used for groups, but groups are based
#           on task names. If a task title includes a colon character,
#           then its group name is the title up to but excluding the
#           first colon; else the group name is the whole task title.
#           This is most often useful when used with bulk task import.
#
#           Both sections and groups are typically used for visual
#           purposes when showing things like reports or timesheets. The
#           calling code can associate data with group and section info,
#           allowing it to independently maintain related information
#           (such as as per-section worked hour totals in reports) if
#           so required.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#           30-Jun-2008 (ADH): Created.
#           09-Aug-2013 (ADH): Complete API redesign to fit new fast
#                              report mechanism. Much cleaner now.
