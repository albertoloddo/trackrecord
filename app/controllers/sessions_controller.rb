  # With the Rails CSRF fix/bodge (sigh), unverified requests - such as that
  # issued by the OpenID provider - cause the session to be reset. Since data
  # about JavaScript support in the sign-in form is stored there, this would
  # be lost and the system would always behave as if JS support were absent.
  #
  # The workaround is to replace the default "handle_unverified_request()"
  # implementation to deal very specifically with just this one case. Having
  # the session reset on login to contain just the JS token and, thereafter,
  # any extra data resulting from the successful (or not) login attempt keeps
  # everything clean and means that any real attempted attacks would fail.
