Thank you for signing up with <%= @site_name %>.

The administrator has set up your account and you can now sign in:

  <%= home_url %>

<% if @user.plaintext_password.present? -%>
Your account has been given a TEMPORARY PASSWORD that can only be used
once. Sign in with your e-mail address and this password. You will then
be asked to change it to something only you know.

  The temporary password is: <%= @user.plaintext_password %>

Since the temporary password has been sent in this e-mail and e-mail is
not secure, you should change sign in AS SOON AS POSSIBLE to set a new
password.

<%   if @user.identity_url.present? -%>
You can also sign in with this OpenID:

  <%= @user.identity_url %>

<%   end -%>
<% elsif @user.identity_url.present? -%>
To sign in, use the following OpenID:

  <%= @user.identity_url %>

<% end -%>
If you wish, you can edit your account settings at any time to change
between using a password and/or OpenID for signing in.

Please note that different individuals are often granted different
levels of access to the system. If you have any questions, please
direct them to the administrator at:

  <%= EMAIL_ADMIN %>

If you did not request this account then someone else may have given an
incorrect e-mail address to the administrator. To resolve the problem,
please contact the administrator at the address above.
