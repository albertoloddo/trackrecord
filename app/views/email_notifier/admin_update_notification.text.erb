Your <%= @site_name %> account settings have been changed.

This was probably done by the site administrator. If you did not expect
any such changes, please IMMEDIATELY enquire about this message by
contacting the administrator at:

  <%= EMAIL_ADMIN %>

<% if @user.plaintext_password.present? && @user.must_reset_password? -%>
Your account has been given a new TEMPORARY PASSWORD that can only be
used once. Sign in with your e-mail address and this password. You will
then be asked to change it to something only you know.

  The temporary password is: <%= @user.plaintext_password %>

Since the temporary password has been sent in this e-mail and e-mail is
not secure, you should change sign in AS SOON AS POSSIBLE to set a new
password.

<%   if @user.identity_url.present? -%>
You can also sign in with this OpenID:

  <%= @user.identity_url %>

<%   end -%>
<% elsif @user.identity_url.present? -%>
Use the following OpenID to sign in:

  <%= @user.identity_url %>

<% end -%>
If you wish, you can edit your account settings at any time to change
between using a password and/or OpenID for signing in.
