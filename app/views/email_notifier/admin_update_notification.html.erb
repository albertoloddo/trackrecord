    <p>
      Your account has been given a new <strong>temporary password</strong>
      that can <strong>only be used once</strong>. Sign in with your e-mail
      address and this password. You will then be asked to change it to
      something only you know.
    <p>

    <ul>
      <li>The temporary password is: <tt><strong><%= @user.plaintext_password %></strong></tt></li>
    </ul>
      
    <p>
      Since the temporary password has been sent in this e-mail and e-mail
      is not secure, you should sign in <strong><em>as soon as
      possible</em></strong> to set a new password.
    </p>
<%   if @user.identity_url.present? -%>

    <p>
      You can also sign in with this OpenID: <tt><strong><%= @user.identity_url %></strong></tt>
    </p>
<%   end -%>
<% elsif @user.identity_url.present? -%>
    <p>
      Use the following OpenID to sign in:
      <tt><strong><%= @user.identity_url %></strong></tt>
    </p>
<% end -%>

    <p>
      If you wish, you can edit your account settings at any time to change
      between using a password and/or OpenID for signing in.
