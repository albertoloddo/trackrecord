  # Set a Date indicating the start of the day which the work packet
  # represents whenever the work packet is saved. This helps a lot with
  # reports, since a report may have to query large numbers of packets
  # by date - we can make the database do that work. It isn't always
  # faster than doing that locally, surprisingly, but the code is much
  # more legible and maintainable.

  # Find work packets in rows related to the given task ID, held in timesheets
  # owned by the given user ID, between the Dates in the given range. The range
  # MUST be inclusive, for reasons discussed below. The results are sorted by
  # work packet date, descending.
  #
  # The task and user IDs are optional. All tasks and/or users will be
  # included in the count if the given task and/or user ID is nil. The date
  # range is mandatory.
  #
  # IMPORTANT - at the time of writing, Rails 2.1 (and earlier versions) will
  # build a BETWEEN statement in SQL with the given range. Although SQL says
  # that the values on either side of BETWEEN should be treated as inclusive,
  # i.e. a Ruby "a..b" kind of range, some databases may treat the right side
  # as exclusive; PostgreSQL is fine, but if in doubt you need to go to the
  # Rails console and run a test. For example, issue something like this:
  #
  #   User.all.collect { |x| x.id }.sort
  #
  # Note any two consecutive IDs listed - e.g. "[1, 2, ...]" - 1 and 2 will do.
  # Use these as part of range conditions for a find:
  #
  #   User.find(:all, :conditions => { :id => 1..2 } )
  #
  # Assuming you actually *have* users with IDs 1 and 2, then both should be
  # returned. If you only get one, BETWEEN isn't working and you need to use
  # another database or change the function below to do something else (e.g.
  # hard-code a condition using ">=" and "<=" if your database supports those
  # operators).
  #
  # A final twist is that Rails' "to_s( :db )" operator assumes all ranges are
  # inclusive and generates SQL accordingly. There's a ticket for this in the
  # case of dates:
  #
  #   http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/8549
  #
  # ...but actually Rails seems to do this for any kind of range - e.g. change
  # the "1..2" to "1...2" in the User find above and note that the generated
  # SQL is the same. We'd expect it to only look for a user with id '1' (or
  # between 1 and 1) in this case.
  #
  # As a result, ensure you only ever pass inclusive ranges to this function.

  # Support find_by_task_user_and_range, find_committed_by_task_user_and_range
  # and find_not_committed_by_task_user_and_range. An extra mandatory second
  # parameter must be set to 'true' to only include work packets from committed
  # timesheets, 'false' for not committed timesheets and 'nil' for either.
  #
  def self.find_by_task_user_range_and_committed( range, committed, task_id = nil, user_id = nil )

    # The 'include' part needs some explanation. We include the timesheet rows,
    # a second order association, because the rows lead to tasks and timesheets.
    # We need to eager-load tasks because the search is limited by task ID. We
    # need to eager-load timesheets because they lead to users and the search is
    # also limited by user ID. Rails supports eager-loading of third and deeper
    # order associations through passing hashes in as the value to ":include".
    # Each key's value is the next level of association. So :timesheet_row is
    # at the second order, pointing to an array giving two third order things;
    # :task and, itself a hash key, :timesheet; since it is a hash key,
    # :timesheet's value is the second-order association of timesheets, or the
    # fourth-order association of the work packets - :user.
    #
    # Ultimately eager-loading means LEFT OUTER JOIN in SQL statements. Due to
    # the way that ActiveRecord assembles the query, using :include rather than
    # :joins with some hard-coded SQL makes for a very verbose query in the
    # "find" case; it's nice and compact for "sum", though. In any event, at
    # least it is a query generated entirely through the database adapter, so
    # it stands a fighting chance of working fine on multiple database types.
