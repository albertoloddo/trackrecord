    # 2011-10-06 (ADH): This is a particularly stupid aspect of Rails 3. It no
    # longer auto-loads code in "lib", leaving you to either manually require
    # it with the implication that just a single file needs the module (but in
    # that case, why's it a module in the first place?) and actually, you're
    # then *not* supposed to require it, because requiring inside applications
    # might break ActiveSupport::Dependencies' (un)loading of code. So in
    # short, if you ever want to put code in "lib", you *must* add this hack.
    # So remind me why the framework suddenly decided to stop doing this itself
    # again? Just to make developers jump through yet *more* pointless hoops
    # for the gratification of the core team? Sigh, sigh, and thrice sigh.
    #
    # 2013-07-26 (ADH): More sighing! This still doesn't eager-load classes in
    # the library folder, so when trying to implement plugin report generators
    # via the TrackRecordReportGenerator* class hierarchy, subclasses would not
    # be loaded and attempts to enumerate them through Base's ".subclasses"
    # would fail. Thus in addition to the line below, please note that there's
    # an "eager_load_report_generators.rb" patch inside "config/initializers".
