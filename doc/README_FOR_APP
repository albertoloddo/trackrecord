== Welcome to the TrackRecord API documentation

This documentation is built automatically. Run "rake doc:reapp" to regenerate
all files. See also the main application README file.

If you want to learn more about the TrackRecord internal structure, consider
getting an idea of the methods defined in the Application Controller and
Application Helper components first. I recommend then looking at the models,
so you become familiar with the application's underlying data structures.

= Charts controller

A Gruff-based charts controller is included to make pie charts (or if extended,
other charts) which you might like. It isn't used "in anger" at present since
the charts aren't really very useful in practice. See partial "shared/_hours"
for an example of how to introduce chart images into your views if you want
them. A version of the 'gruff' plugin is present in "vendor/plugins" to support
the feature and you'll need the RMagick gem ("gem install rmagick") along with
all its dependencies. Font "PetitaBold.ttf" is kept in the root of the
application for graph text; change this by editing the value of "GRAPH_FONT" in
file "config/initializers/general_config.rb".

To fetch an example stand-alone image as a test, visit your site with the
following path:

  /charts/0?committed=128&duration=168&not_committed=4&width=128
