Version 2.04, 2013-07-11
========================

Please see the version 2.00 notes later for information about updating from
earlier version.

Version 2.04 fixes the following bugs that were found in v2.03:

- Sometimes sorting a timesheet's rows would not fully sort them - you would
  have to sort a second time to get the correct result.

- Reordered timesheet rows were not maintained when the timesheet was saved
  and used as a template for another week; the row order would be reset.

There are the following enhancements:

- Timesheets can now be set to auto-sort their contents when rows are
  added or removed.

- Report titles, if set, are included in all report output for easier
  identification.


Version 2.02 and 2.03, 2013-04-25
=================================

Please see the version 2.00 notes later for information about updating from
earlier version.

Version 2.02 fixes the following bugs that were found in v2.01:

- Saved reports can now be deleted. Related code tidied up in a few other
  places too.

Version 2.03 fixes the following bugs that were found in v2.02 on a live
deployment, rather than with test data only:

- Sometimes duplicating a timesheet would keep apparently duplicating one
  or more of its rows more than once. This was actually due to an
  iterator removing a new timesheet's default rows, as specified in the
  user's control panel, failing to actually iterate over all objects. It
  seems an explicit call to "all" is required on associated collections
  before "each" to reliably iterate across all objects (!). A lot of
  other files have been updated as a precaution, following the same
  pattern.

- In passing while testing this fix, noticed that attribute protection
  code in the Project model was nonsense (copy and paste error); also,
  the custom initializer override parameters at creation, which were
  only subsequently correctable by editing the instance. This fault was
  replicated in Task, Project, User and Customer models; fixed in all.



Version 2.01, 2013-04-09
========================

Please see the version 2.00 notes later for information about updating from
earlier version.

This release fixes the following bugs that were found in v2.00:

- Rails 3 converts dates to dates-with-time-and-timezone using the server's
  local timezone rather than UTC as in Rails 2. This could lead to work
  packets and timesheets having incorrect cached date-time values. Editing
  timesheets would show no issues but reports might be wrong. Noticed on
  the Endurance installation when the server automatically changed from
  UTC to UTC+1 on April 1st. Fixed.

- Administrator users were unable to show saved reports from other users
  unless they were shared, even though they could edit them. Administrators
  can now see all reports.

- Date-based searching in "Manage Timesheets" was broken. Now fixed.



Version 2.00, 2013-03-27
========================

Important
---------

TrackRecord now requires Rails 3.2. It does not run on Rails 2. As a result,
the Ruby version requirements are increased too; you need version 1.9.3 at
patch 392 or later. The upgrade instructions below assume that this is
already available.

On the client side, TrackRecord's views now assume a competent HTML 5, CSS 2
capable browser is used. It looks best on modern CSS 3 aware browsers such as
recent Safari, Chrome, Opera and Firefox builds. JavaScript is very strongly
recommended but not required, so if you have it turned off in your browser
for any reason or your browser doesn't support it, TrackRecord can still be
used. Internet Explorer is untested and not officially supported at any
version, though it may work in practice.


Upgrading
---------

To upgrade, first do a full database backup in case anything goes wrong!
Next, unpack TrackRecord somewhere new - don't copy it on top of an existing
installation. Make any configuration changes you made to your old copy:

- You can safely just copy over the old 'config/database.yml'
- ...and 'config/initializers/email_config.rb'
- ...and 'config/initializers/general_config.rb' files

- Possibly port over your e-mail sending configuration for ActionMailer
  in 'config/environments/production.rb' or '...development.rb' - see:
  http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_mailer_basics.html#action-mailer-configuration

You must also set a secret key in 'config/initializers/secret_token.rb';
this is the equivalent of the key that in previous versions lived inside
'config/environment.rb'. Comments in the file give detailed instructions.

The gem dependencies for TrackRecord are all listed in 'Gemfile'. To get
these installed, from inside the 'trackrecord' directory (the same directory
as this change log file and 'Gemfile'), run:

  bundle install

...to make sure all the relevant gems required by the updated TrackRecord
are present. Now make sure your web server is offline and bring your database
up to date (changing 'production' to 'development' if being rightly cautious
and testing on a development copy first):

  rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production

Then you should be able to start your web server again. There may be some
server changes needed for Rails 3; consult your web server documentation if
necessary. I recommend using Phusion Passenger, if possible, to serve Rails
application such as TrackRecord.

If you have trouble running 'bundle' or the migration, in the first
instance check Google for the error message you see - upgrading Rails and
using bundles is very rarely a pain-free process and the issues will usually
be to do with your computing environment rather than TrackRecord's own code.


Changes from version 1.54 (see the v1.x branch for more v1.x changes)
-------------------------

- New major version number reflects bump to Rails 3.2 / Ruby 1.9.
  + Functionality is an evolution and refinement over TrackRecord v1.x,
    rather than a major overhaul.

- Improved navigation flow throughout.
  + More consistent and logical navigation options in some places.
  + Updated visual theme makes things easier to read.

- Reports can be saved for recollection and modification later.
  + Can be kept private or shared to other TrackRecord users.
  + Sharing URLs are very simple, since they just refer to a saved.
    database object rather than recording all report parameters.
  + Old-style long report URLs from TrackRecord v1.5 are supported and
    create a temporary user report.
  + Quick report generation buttons available when managing or viewing
    customers, projects, tasks and users.

- All list search forms extended to at long last support date ranges.

- Improved labels for customers, projects and tasks everywhere - link back
  to the original item, with tooltips giving code and description details.

- The beginnings of proper internationalisation are in place, though a lot
  of messages are not yet run through the language files.

- The 'gruff' gem is commented out inside 'Gemfile' to prevent annoying
  dependencies. The graph controller mechanism is still present but will
  not work unless you uncomment the gruff line in 'Gemfile' and re-run
  "bundle install". It isn't used by default anywhere in TrackRecord.

- Bugs related to tasks with no project or projects with on customer fixed.

- Old-style report URLs are now reliable, rather than leading to 404 errors
  on older TrackRecord versions if active tasks had become inactive or vice
  versa. Now the active-vs-inactive lists are reassessed at generation time
  (and the signed in user's task permissions taken into account as usual).
